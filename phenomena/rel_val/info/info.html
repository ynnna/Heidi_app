<h2>Relative validity effect</h2>


<p> These simulations accompany the ones summarrised in
<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55131-002"><span class="citation">Honey,
   Dwyer and Iliescu (2020b:</span></a>pp 171-174; Figure 2).
   The relative validity effect was one of the phenomena that
motivated the impetus for the adoption of a pooled error term.
The relative validity design introduced by
<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-55131-002">
  <span class="citation"></span> Wagner, Logan, Haberlandt and Price (1968)</a>
  is shown in <span id ="refTable">Table 1</span>.
The target stimulus (A) that was paired
with a reinforcer on 50% of trials (indicated by “+”) and was
nonreinforced on the remaining trials (indicated by “-”). Critically, in the true
 discrimination condition,
when <span id="code_style">A</span> was reinforced
it was paired with stimulus <span id="code_style">B</span> (on AB+ trials),
and when <span id="code_style">A</span> was nonreinforced it was paired with
stimulus <span id="code_style">C</span> (on AC- trials). In contrast, for animals in the pseudo
discrimination condition, the <span id="code_style">AB</span> and
<span id="code_style">AC</span> stimulus pairs were equally
often reinforced and nonreinforced (AB+/– and AC+/–). That is, the reinforcement
history of <span id="code_style">A</span>, considered alone,
 was the same in
the two conditions, but the reinforcement history of  <span id="code_style">B</span> and
<span id="code_style">C</span> differed between the true discrimination and pseudo discrimination conditions.

</p>

<p>
  At test, <span id="code_style">A</span>,
  <span id="code_style">B</span> and
   <span id="code_style">C</span> were presented individually.
Reflecting the fact that in the true discrimination condition <span id="code_style">B</span>
was always reinforced and <span id="code_style">C</span> never reinforced, conditioned responding
 to <span id="code_style">B</span> was higher than to <span id="code_style">C</span>.
 In contrast, in the pseudo discrimination
 condition <span id="code_style">B</span> and <span id="code_style">C</span>
 elicited equivalent levels of responses,
 reflecting the fact that these stimuli were paired with
 reinforcement and nonreinforcement equally often. The critical
 result was that less responding was evident to <span id="code_style">A</span> in the true
  discrimination condition than the pseudo discrimination condition.


</p>

<p>If the <span id="code_style_greek">&beta;</span>  value is the same for
  reinforced and nonreinforced trials,
  then  the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239030972_A_theory_of_Pavlovian_conditioning_The_effectiveness_of_reinforcement_and_non-reinforcement">
  <span class="citation"> Rescorla and Wagner (1972)</span></a> model is constrained to predict that
   <span id="code_style">A</span> will have equivalent associative strength
    in the true discrimination and pseudo discrimination conditions. This forced
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239030972_A_theory_of_Pavlovian_conditioning_The_effectiveness_of_reinforcement_and_non-reinforcement">
  <span class="citation"> Rescorla and Wagner (1972)</span></a> to assume that
   the <span id="code_style_greek">&beta;</span>
    value is higher for reinforced than nonreinforced trials so that the gain in associative strength generated by reinforcement is greater than the loss in associative strength based on nonreinforcement.
</p>

<p>In contrast, according to
<span id="heidired">HeiDI</span>, it is possible for  <span id="code_style">A</span> to “borrow”
the associative properties of  <span id="code_style">B</span>
and  <span id="code_style">C</span> (via A-B and A-C associative
links), and furthermore that the development of these
 <span id="code_style">A</span> -  <span id="code_style">B</span> and
 <span id="code_style">A</span> -  <span id="code_style">C</span> associative
links are differentially affected by the reciprocal  <span id="code_style">US</span> -  <span id="code_style">CS</span>
links
in the true discrimination and pseudo discrimination conditions
 (even when the A-US associations are equivalent across conditions).

</p>

<p>
<span id="code_style">Panel B</span> shows
 that the values returned for the
<span id="code_style">A</span> -  <span id="code_style">B</span>
association for the true discrimination are smaller than those
for the <span id="code_style">A</span> -  <span id="code_style">C</span>  association.
 This is because the <span id="code_style">US</span> -  <span id="code_style">B</span>
  association
restricts the growth in the <span id="code_style">A-B</span> association on
<span id="code_style">AB+</span> 
trials (because the US and A “compete” as associates of A), while there the
absence of the  <span id="code_style">US</span> on
 <span id="code_style">AC-</span> trials, means that the
  <span id="code_style">A</span> -  <span id="code_style">C</span>  association not
 be affected in the same way. Therefore,
 <span id="code_style">A</span> will be able to borrow
relatively little of the strong excitatory properties of
<span id="code_style">B</span>, but rather
more of the weak inhibitory properties of <span id="code_style">C</span>.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, inspection
of <span id="code_style">Panel D</span> shows that the values returned for
the <span id="code_style">A-B</span> and <span id="code_style">A-C</span>
associations are equivalently strong after a pseudo discrimination (the US will interfere with both A-B and A-C links on AB+ and AC+ trials respectively, but not on AB- and AC- trials).
 And, because  <span id="code_style">B</span> and <span id="code_style">C</span>
are both moderately excitatory, then the presentation
of <span id="code_style">A</span> will be able to borrow excitatory strength
from both <span id="code_style">B</span>
and <span id="code_style">C</span>.

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<h3>Simulations tab</h3>
<span id="heidired">HeiDI</span>'s predictions can be explored using the four sliders.

<h4>Sliders</h4>
<ul>
  <li> <span id="code_style">Number of trials</span> (range 4 - 100) - Sets the number of trials desired.
    Note: There are four type of trials which constrain the range of possible trial number.

  <li> <span id="code_style_greek">&alpha; A</span> (range 0.1 - 1) - Sets the perceived CS value for stimulus <span id="code_style">A</span>. </li>
  <li> <span id="code_style_greek">&alpha; B</span> (range 0.1 - 1) - Sets the perceived CS value for the stimulus <span id="code_style">B</span>. </li>
  <li> <span id="code_style_greek">&alpha; C</span> (range 0.1 - 1) - Sets the perceived CS value for the stimulus <span id="code_style">C</span>. </li>
  <li> <span id="code_style_greek">&beta;</span> (range 0.1 - 1) - Sets the perceived value for the <span id="code_style">US<SUB>1</SUB></span>.</li>
